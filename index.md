#### About Logistics

The course is a continuation of _Algebra and Number Theory 1_, and it covers **Class Field Theory**. It plays a fundamental role in many branches of modern Number Theory, and thus it is one of the standard topics for Ph.D. students in the field. The course teaches the statements and proofs of Local and Global Class Field Theories. Along the way, we also discuss group cohomology and other related topics. Students will learn the course materials by attending lectures by the instructor and doing homework on a regular basis.
